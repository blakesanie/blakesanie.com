## From Infielder to Triathlete

So long are my days of fielding ground balls and swinging at fastballs. Though I grew up casually cruising mountain bikes in California, jumping apartments and cities throughout college prevented me from leveling up in endurance efforts.

During grad school, a friend recommended I try my hand at Georgia Tech's Navy Seal Fitness Challenge - of which one tribulation was to complete a 500 yard swim in fewer than 10 minutes. So I got in the pool. In the summer that followed, a group of fellow associates invited me to run down the West Side Highway from the office to the World Trade Center, and back. Seeing that running was more than a punishment for losing a baseball game, I (over)ambitiously embarked on a do-it-yourself marathon two months after.

I was content. I felt good with my level of activity. But I will never forget the shock I experienced when I caught wind of my high school classmate competing Ironman California. I was tracking every split while simulataneously architecting machine learning models for a group project in a Georgia Tech research building. He finished the course, a major accomplishment - and he did so faster than every other competitor in his age group. He kindly offered his time to meet and address my curiosity. He only expanded it. I thought: maybe, possible, perhaps a 70.3 was in sight.

I was missing one piece - the bike. With the completion of Master's degree in sight, and planned my move to Chicago with its lakefront trail in mind. And I registered for Ironman 70.3 Wisconsin.

Once getting situated, my dedication to training all three disciplines of triathlon increased, and my learnings soared. Here's a brain-dump of takeaways spanning the complete timeline of my Ironman 70.3 experience.

## Before Race Week: Research, Training, & Everyday Life

- One week doesn't change anything

  - Enjoy a vacation. You practically won't fall off track. At the same time, a week of awol training won't get you too far.

- Open water will induce panic

  - Build comfort looking down through endless green. Even now, swallowing less water remains a goal.

- Don't kick so hard

  - Over an endurance distance, invest in breathing comfort and lactic acid buildup. Focus on an immaculate catch, pull, and stroke recovery.

- Respect the 10% rule

  - Don't increase weakly efforts too quickly

- Peeing mid swim/bike is a skill

  - Still a work in progress

- Don't neglect legs

  - Your IT band will thank you. Single leg everything, if possible.

- Practice peeling off your wetsuit

  - You need to take it off after traininig swims, anyway.

- Practice a Chaos swim

  - During a race, swimming is a contact sport. It may be best to know the feeling of a foot to the goggle before the big day.

- Go nuts

  - Train like an animal if you feel like it.

- Race fees are expensive

  - Better to accept this fact sooner rather than later. Yes, a great deal of fees cover insurance and logistics, but non-Ironman branded races will be lighter on the wallet.

- Learn how strava works

  - More than instagram for athletes who want to level up their coworkers - a training tool to track fitness, plan routes, compete on segment leaderboards, integrate metrics with wearable devices, build traininig plans... the list goes on!

- Go Register

  - Only then does the finish line become real. Indulge in the "what did I just sign up for?" feeling and double down on your grind.

- Learn the Physics

  - Buoyancy, hydrodynamics, and aerodynamics will take you just as far as fitness itself!

- Learn the anatomy (legs)

  - The body is smart, but it isn't simple. Learn to stay healthy, improve oxygen utilization, and build endurance throughout your musculosceletal system.

- Avoid an infini-training cycle

  - Define a training season and offseason. Don't lose purpose because there is no end (checkpoint, really) in sight.

- Figure out an indoor setup

  - The sun doesn't always shine. Chicagoans know what I'm taking about.

- Find a flow from workouts to work, and vice versa

  - Building a training schedule that integrates with work and life is a balancing act in itself. Find the best bang-for-buck within your own time.

- Scout the course

  - Know what it means for hills to be "rolling". Build familiarity and gain a homefield advantage. Better yet, bring some friends and share the experience!

- If you don't know what a saddle sore is, you will.

  - Invest in zinc oxide.

- Caffeine is a PED

  - Probably the most researched stimulant. It's hard to go back.

- Swimming heals all

  - Not just a skill to improve, but a form of physical therapy and meditation in itself.

- Apple watch can't hang

  - The "Series" models may die before you finish a marathon. The Ultra may die before you finish a century ride. If any triathlon longer than a 70.3 is in mind, go Garmin.

- Real men wear speedos

  - The talk of the town: jammers are for twelve-year-olds.

## Race Week: Gearing Up for the Big Day

- There will be dummies

  - Too many of the "of course I can swim" type who proceed to trot a half marathon, untrained.

- The Racing chip goes on the left

  - Otherwise you'll drop your chain!

- Overcommunicate

  - Always give a firm "on your left" to avoid confusion of any degree

- Transition 1 sucks

  - Generally where heart rate peaks during a triathlon. A full sprint, still wet and disoriented from the swim, into a clean bike mount? Thank goodness you do it once.

- Show up to slot allocation

  - Qualifications are highly forgiving of finishing place and may catch you by surprise!

- Pack transition with options in mind

  - Allow for mid-transition flexibility. Lay out socks of all lengths, sleeves for all appendages, gloves, a gilet, and even a waterproof shell.

- Know which gear you're good to toss

  - By prepared to toss bottles if additional hydration is needed, or any clothing if it isn't serving you well.

- Swim turns are highly contested

  - Determine how hard you want to battle for shaving a few yards, and at what cost.

- Choose to start on the inside

  - Where you line up is free - may as well start on track to shave yards before everyone else.

- Don't worry about the bike drafting rule

  - Cyclists become spread out after T1. Drafting truly requires the intention to draft, and risk a penalty. Focus on simply gaining ground.

- Bottle handoffs are harder than they look

  - Going 20mph, bottles will bounce off your palm and leave you off balance. Call it a skill issue, but slowing down may be worth a more secure transfer.

- Charge your groupset batteries

  - Don't ride a fixie into the finish line. SRAM cultists know that the front and rear derailer batteries are interchangeable (swap if the rear dies)... Shimano falls short in this category!

- Wear identifyable gear

  - Don't tell friends and family to look for the black wetsuit or white road bike.

- The course isn't 70.3 miles

  - A combination of innacurate segment lengths, unintuitive transition points, and your affinity for corner cutting.

- Body gluide everything

  - Staying slippery will prevent swimmers from pulling you back, ease wetsuit peeling, putting on socks, and eliminating chaffing. Cover every square inch of skin, if you're dedicated.

- Goggles under the cap

  - Don't lose your goggles due to contact with another swimmer. Are you prepared to finish the swim with your bare eyes?

- Make friends

  - Being on the course for hours, get to know other athletes just as crazy as you are. Conversation will also keep you in Zone 2 and prevent you from starting the bike/run too hot!

- Ask someone else to drive home

  - Either you raced so hard, walking becomes a challenge, or you partied so hard, you need a DD. Go for both.

- Be nutrition flexible

  - Bottles and gels fall. Be prepared to feast on gels and electrolyte drinks, if necessary.

- Amazon prime is your best friend

  - In the week leading up to your race, you will acquire so many products and gadgets out of panic. Dominate the race and return what didn't work!

- Gels are barely caloric

  - A typical gel only contains 100 calories, which you will burn each mile you run. As a warning, the caffeine does add up quickly.

- Passing others is such a joy

  - Especially if they sport an Ironman calf tatoo or ride a $14k TT bike.

## After: All Done, What's Next?

- Who needs a Tattoo

  - Is it necessary for you to interalize your self worth? If you didn't finish a full, don't consider it, either.

- Everyone will ask you what's next

  - And saying "I don't know" is arguably the most appropriate and respectable response.

- Hold your horses on a new bike

  - How much higher could you have placed if you saved a few dozen watts? Just as high as if you dedicated time to strength training and zwift in the offseason for $20 per month. But I understand the temptation, believe me.

- Finisherpix is not worth it

  - The photos that draw smiles (and Instagram likes) are with friends and family after your big accomplishment.

- Now's a great opportunity to cool down

  - Settle back into a laxidazical lifestyle, you earned it! Go enjoy every season of that new netflix show. Sleep in until noon on Saturdays.

- Now's a great opportunity to heat up

  - Alternatively, you've come so far - why back down? Treat the moment as a checkpoint for an even greater goal. Don't waste time and tell yourself you'll rise back to your current level of fitness "one day".

- Cut your bracelet off, but the bike stem sticker can stay

  - Enjoy your aura, but ground back to reality by Monday. Still, I'm a fan of the tradition of seeing your race number on your bike - until it gets replaced in the next race.
