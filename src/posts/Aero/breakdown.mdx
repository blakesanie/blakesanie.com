Progressing along my endurance triathlon adventure during the cold winter means crafting an indoor training regiment without compromise. Yes, I converted my bike into a stationary rig and sprinting away on virtual routes (all standard practice), though diving deeper, I sought a way to optimize my body positioning before hitting the road again in the spring.

My search of existing tools turned empty - applying advanced kinematic theory within a computationally defined environment seemed too much a moonshot, especially when targetting a consumer hardware runtime. Still, no reason stood to prove my vision unattainable.

Being equal parts athletic competitor and technological innovator, I took matters into my own hands.

## Creating Aero

To kick off 2024, I designed and developed <a href="/aero" target="_blank" >Aero</a> - the world's first consumer-accessible virtual wind tunnel, focused on helping cyclists minimize air resistance due to suboptimal body geometry. Even better, complete functionality sits right behind the same web browser you are using to read this.

Finding success in Aero's creation required seamlessly stitching together advanced applications of physical mechanics and machine learning. The below sections outline and further dissect these respective components.

## Physics Theory, Applied

Rocketing at significant speeds through the still air simplifies to the disrupting of a fluid at equilibrium. In the most basic of forms, air resistance increases linearly with respect to cross sectional area, and quadratically with respect to velocity:

$F_{D}=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_D A$

<div class="allInline">
  with drag force $F_D$, fluid density $\rho$, velocity $v$, drag coefficient
  $C_D$, and cross sectional area $A$. However, this baseline kinematic model
  relies on many material generalizations and does not consider chaotic fluid
  dynamics (i.e. turbulent flow) that result from nontrivial object shapes and
  positions. In fact, my desire to model the effects of{" "}
  <span class="italic">arbitrary</span> body shapes eliminates all possibilties
  of a closed-form approximation for air resistance. Putting pen and paper
  aside, pivoting towards a simulation-based approach allows for situational
  precision while leveraging academically studied numerical and computational
  methods.

### Modelling Fluid Dynamics

Cutting-edge fluid simulation methods follow one of two paradigms.

- `Eulerian` approaches discretize and fix the environment (grid or mesh), each managing fluid behavior within their respective bounds.

- `LaGrangian` approaches discretize and fix the fluid (as particles), each managing their respective state (position, velocity, etc) within the environment.

Aero's fluid simulation relies on an Eulerian method in order to ensure uniform measurement across the environment while easily parallizing underlying grid-based computations.

Deeper, I evolved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lattice-Boltzmann Algorithm</a> to support the platform's wind tunnel dynamics - more on improvements later. The method operates as follows:

1. Form a lattice-structured environent, where each cell of the environment grid stores an eight-way particle distribution: moving North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West, North-West, and staying at rest. The density of particles in each catagory are initialized to reflect a constant rate of laminar flow (a state of equilibrium that observes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Navier-Stokes Equations</a>).

2. Propogate the expected densitives to the corresponding cell. For instance, transfer the density of North-traveling particles to the cell above the current. Careful formulation of this sequential process is necessary to ensure densities are not overwritten while still a dependency in pending computatations. This is called the "Stream" step. <span class="italic">Handle collisions by reflecting movement into barriers back onto the source cell</span>.

3. Smooth each cell's new fluid movement distribution towards an equilibrium state. This "Collide" phase is introduces nonlinearity to fluid movement - a realistic mechanism to handle movement dampening and compounding.
   Find an in-depth explanation of the relevant mathematical foundation <a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/physics.ndsu.edu/Wagner/LBbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

4. Jump to step 2, forming a cycle that models passage of time.

A few details in tehnical implementation require attention to complete an effective simulation. These include:

- Resetting environment boundaries to uniform equilibrium density (repeat as step 1 at edges of canvas) to keep the fluid moving in the indended direction. This can happen with any time interval, though tighter intervals promote simulation stability.

- Dynamically shifting the initial air flow point (front of wind tunnel) to accomodate the object's shape and position within the wind tunnel. This extension to the Lattice-Boltzmann algorithm prevents differences in fluid behavior across ends of the wind tunnel because the the object's position relative within the wind tunnel is unchanging.

### Relating Speed, Position, Power, and Force

With the appropriate simulation method by my side, I then needed a quantitiative model between the measures of interest. As a starting point, I discovered the below real-world data aggregated by the team at <a href="https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/body-position-and-aerodynamics-on-a-bike" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silca</a> relates power savings and cycling speed in various body positions.

I am mainly interested in modelling maximum power savings, which occurs in
the Aero Bars position. Using <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pqub09as7u" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this Desmos plot</a>, I found the relationship between maximum power savings (Watts) and cycling speed (m/s) to be:

$P_\text{saved}=c v^3,\hspace{2mm} c=.0450364$

<InlineImg

  alt="Regression model between cycling speed and maximum power savings."
/>

<div class="allInline">
  At this point, I needed a means of relating simulation mechanics to the above
  regression model. The simulation progresses with a frame rate $f=24$ frames
  per second, with each frame running $n=40$ iterations of the "Streaming" and
  "Colliding" process. During each frame, I must collect the momentum $p$
  applied against the cyclist. An equivalent description of this quantity is the
  forward momentum the cyclist must additionally generate to maintain constant
  road speed.
</div>
<div class="allInline">
  $p$ is found by collecting the net mass of air "streamed" into a barrier cell,
  before being reflected back onto the source cell, times the current speed. Let
  us not forget that this momentum acts as a vector across both principle axes,
  thus $p_x$ and $p_y$ are computed respectively by net Eastward air movement
  and net Southward air movement. For simplicity, I will focus on fluid momentum
  in the $x$ direction. Note that $v$ already lives along the $x$ axis, as the
  wind tunnel blows air horizontally.
</div>

$p_x=mv=v\sum_{i=0}^{n}\sum_{b\in\text{barriers}}(\text{NE}_b + \text{E}_b + \text{SE}_b - \text{SW}_b - \text{W}_b - \text{NW}_b)$

$m_{\text{air}_x}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\sum_{b\in B}(\text{NE}_b + \text{E}_b + \text{SE}_b - \text{SW}_b - \text{W}_b - \text{NW}_b)$

$m_{\text{air}_y}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\sum_{b\in B}(\text{SW}_b + \text{S}_b + \text{SE}_b - \text{NE}_b - \text{N}_b - \text{NW}_b)$

$\vec{m_\text{air}}=\langle m_{\text{air}_x},m_{\text{air}_y} \rangle$

$\vec{W_\text{air}} = \frac{1}{2}\vec{m_\text{air}}v^2$

$\vec{F_\text{air}} = \vec{W_\text{air}} \Delta x,\hspace{2mm}\Delta x = v \Delta t = \frac{v}{f}$

$F_\text{resistance} = F_{\text{air}_x} + F_\text{rr}$

$F_\text{rr} = C_\text{rr} F_{\text{air}_y},\hspace{2mm} C_\text{rr} = 0.0025$

### Chasing Power and Force Savings

However, I required a baseline measure of air resistance's effects that operates independent of speed, since speed can change throughout the simulation. A linear relationship between fluid mass colliding with the cyclist and speed is easily induced - at rest, air resistance imposes no effect, though as speed increases, distance traversed per unit time increases proportionally. Because one can expect concentrated regions of the atmosphere to exist in fluid equilibirum, with uniform density, speed must be proportional to the mass of air colliding with the cyclist per unit time.

<div class="allInline">
  Hence, we must take a step back from momentum. Dividing our measure $p_x$ by
  speed $v$ directly yields $m_x$ - the mass of air colliding with the cyclist
  in the $x$ direction during a frame's duration. I designed a necessary
  calibration, where the cyclist is instructed to hold a "Hoods" position, then
  their lowest possible "Aero Bars" position. During this short time window, the
  program collects the quantities neede to find maximum and minimum $m_x$
  measures: $m_\text{max}$ and $m_\text
  {min}$, respectively.
</div>

With these calibrated baselines, the platform has all it needs to estimate power savings with the current barrier state (reflecting body position) at the current speed. First, interpolate the current fluid mass colliding with the cyclist per frame $m$
