## Motivation

On New Year's Eve, I came across a puzzling twitter post:

</div>

I thought, surely, the answer must be a nasty decimal - I was far from wrong, and my curiosity led me down a road to a mind-blowing realization.

## Pen Meets Paper

With a bit of calculus, the answer was in close reach. To my delight, my work came out to a clean `2022`. Ah, yes - only now had I realized I stumbled upon a New Years Eve joke!
Still, my curiosity persisted - is this merely a coincidence, or a generalizable rule?

## A Beautify Discovery

<div class="allInline">

I hypothesized that **for all $r>0$, if a circle with radius $r$ is inscribed in the standard parabola, then the subsequent inscribed circle must have radius $r+1$**.

</div>

More formally, I want to determine if:

<div class="allInline center">
  center$_i + r_i = $ center $_{i + 1} - r_{i + 1}$
</div>

<div class="allInline">

**for all $i>0$**, _not restricted to whole numbers_.

</div>

## The Radius Segment

<div class="allInline">
First, we must model the radius of each circle as the segment connecting (for simplicity) the $+x$ half of the standard parabola to the $y$-axis that is simultaneously normal to such parabola.

Given this interpretation, we can find the slope of the radius by finding the negative reciprocal of the parabola's slope.

</div>

$$ f(x)=x^2 $$
$$ f\prime (x)=2x $$
$$ \downarrow $$

<div class="allInline center">
slope of radius $=\frac{-1}{f\prime (x)}=\frac{-1}{2x}$
</div>

<div class="allInline">
With this slope, we can express the radius as the sum of horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal component is, well, the definition of $x$. The vertical component, fascinatingly, is always $1/2$, since moving backwards $x$ units along the $x$-axis yields a $y$-change of $(\frac{-1}{2x}) * -x = -\frac{1}{2}$.
</div>

<InlineImg

  alt="Component breakdown of radius"
/>

<div class="allInline">
  Hence, the length of the radius is the magnitude of the resulting hypotenuse.
  We can calculate the $y$-value of the center accordingly.
</div>

$r_i=\sqrt{x_i^2+\frac{1}{2}^2}$

$$ \downarrow $$

$ x_i = \sqrt{r_i^2-\frac{1}{4}} $

<div class="allInline center">
  center$_i=f(x_i)+\frac{1}
  {2}=r_i^2+\frac{1}
  {4}$
</div>

## Proof by Induction

### Base Case

<div class="allInline">
  Fundamentally, there exists a circle of radius of radius $r > 0$, and its
  center can be found by $r^2 + \frac{1}
  {4}$. The circle with $r = 0$ is excluded from the domain since it constructs a
  point. By the way, notice anything special about the constant $\frac{1}
  {4}$? It's the focus of the standard parabola!
</div>

### Inductive Step

<div class="allInline">
  Having supported the base case, if we prove that our hypothesis holds true
  when transitioning from $i$ to $i + 1$, then our hypothesis must hold true for
  all $i > 0$.
</div>

Let's begin by stating our hypothesis, and manipulating the relationship until a conclusion is reached.

<div class="allInline center">
  center$_i + r_i = $ center $_{i + 1} - r_{i + 1}$
</div>

$r_i^2+\frac{1}{4}+r_i=r_{i+1}^2+\frac{1}{4}-r_{i+1}$

$r_{i+1}^2-r_{i+1}-(r_i^2+r_i)=0$

<div class="center">Now factor using the Quadratic Formula, where</div>

$a=1$
$b=-1$
$c=r_i^2+r_i$

$r_{i+1}=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

$=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4(r_i^2+r_i)}}{2}$

$=\frac{1\pm(2r_i+1)}{2}$

$=\cancel{r_i}, r_i+1$

$\therefore r_{i+1} = r_i+1$

In conclusion, we accept the hypotheses - the radius of every circle inscribed in the standard parabola is one greater than that of the circle underneath.

üòÇ Ah, and that's why the tweet was made "traditionally".

## What about non-standard Parabolas?

So far, we have seen that inscribing circles by the horizontal bounds of the standard parabola and circle beneath is possible for incrementing radii, starting at any non-zero radius.

<div class="allInline">
  Keep imagining the standard parabola with its inscribed circles. When the
  function becomes $f(x) = ax^2$, where $a = 1$ does not hold, a vertical (and
  in a way, horizontal) stretch transformation is applied. Hence, this same
  transformation will be applied to the inscribed circles, yielding ellipses -
  the unique property of inscribed circles with incrementing radii does not hold
  here.
</div>

## Visualization

To verify my work so far, I wrote a one-line python program to generate the equations for first 20 inscribed circles of whole-number radii.

```python
[print(f'x^2 +(y - {r}^2 - 1/4)^2 <= {r}^2') for r in range(1, 101)]
```

Yielding the output:

```
x^2 +(y - 1^2 - 1/4)^2 <= 1^2
x^2 +(y - 2^2 - 1/4)^2 <= 2^2
x^2 +(y - 3^2 - 1/4)^2 <= 3^2
...
x^2 +(y - 99^2 - 1/4)^2 <= 99^2
x^2 +(y - 100^2 - 1/4)^2 <= 100^2
```

Pasting into [Desmos](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.desmos.com%2Fcalculator%2F9rtrnrpzlh) renders the beautiful phenomenon I stumbled upon to start 2022.
